First, open your arduino IDE add Time Library from the AnalogRead_Library folder, then open the AnalogRead_Code folder to upload the arduino skech to your arduino, also connect 2 anlog input sensor to your arduino. By this time your should already installed the processing from processing.org. Open the Processing folder to run the SyncArduinoClock program to set Arduino Time from your computer. Or you can find Current Timestamp at: http://www.currenttimestamp.com/ to enter it on the Serial Monitor

Let me know if your have any question.
